This weekend was a good one - spending time with family. I have not had a chance to sit down and program just yet, as we are getting ready for a holiday away,
and of course having a social life means you cant just sit down at a computer and code for 48 hours straight each Friday Evening (some would say that is a good thing..).

Over the weekend I had an idea to try and solve a project issue I have had for my investment project - that being, how to create variables for each quality out of a dataframe in Python.

To try to give a simpler explanation; the data was taken from a PostgreSQL database and put into the Python programme but was in a Dataframe. I am still learning, so 
I was not sure how best to store this. 

I will try to store the values by using Classes, Objects and Constructors, to get more experienece with them, and also because it seems like the best way to do so.

That being said, I am currently not thinking at 100% so please take the above and my code with a pinch of salt!

Anyway, I'm going to get some food.

Until next time.
